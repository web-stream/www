# Cloud Stack Problem

I warned people many years ago to not base their entire stack on a single cloud provider. 
They didn't listen, made fun of me, and I actually nodded for some time - it's more efficient, right? 

What could go wrong. 

Now, Parler's case proved me right


because it's limiting. You base your entire system around proprietary software/services, and then you're stuck - you can't migrate anywhere else, 
without re-writing huge chunks of your code. The code that happened to be yours, is still dependent on cloud solutions, so it goes to waste as well - you end up doubling hours spent on achieving the same outcome, if you decide it's time to move. And that's the best case scenario, if you're unlucky, you're getting kicked out like @Parler was with 72hr notice. 
That's the rational explanation. I also don't trust Amazon, Google or Microsoft. tldr; out of principles.
